### The Idea Behind It

In today’s job market, most resumes are first reviewed by **AI-powered Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)** before ever reaching a human recruiter.  
This means that **keywords, structure, and relevance** matter more than ever.

Nowadays, almost every recruiter uses **AI models powered by Large Language Models (LLMs)** to scan and analyze resumes automatically.  
These systems don’t just look for experience — they evaluate tone, structure, and keyword alignment to predict candidate fit.

When I moved to the United States in 2025 with my wife — who came to pursue her master’s degree in Data Analytics — I realized how tough it can be to adapt a resume for U.S. companies.  
Even with a solid background as a **Software Engineer**, the process of tailoring resumes for each position was slow, repetitive, and often confusing.

That’s when I decided to create an intelligent assistant — a **Resume Optimization GPT** — that could automatically analyze a job description, adjust a resume accordingly, and predict the likelihood of being shortlisted for an interview.

### How It Works

This GPT role acts as a **specialized HR assistant** with strong analytical and writing skills.  
It follows structured steps to edit, review, and score resumes based on the specific job description provided.

To make the process more accurate and flexible, I keep a **base resume file** that contains all my professional information, skills, and experiences.  
This file serves as the **foundation** for the GPT to work from — ensuring that every version of the resume stays faithful to my background.

Additionally, I included a **custom section in the prompt** where I can add **extra personal context or new details** before each run.  
This allows the AI to generate **different versions of my resume**, each one **precisely tailored** to the target job — but also with a touch of **spontaneity and innovation**, making every output unique and natural.

After analyzing the input, the system produces:

- A fully rewritten resume adapted to the job description.
- A **percentage score** estimating how likely it is to be shortlisted by an AI or recruiter.
- A list of **important keywords** to strengthen the document.
- **Warnings** about weak or missing sections.
- And a summary of **possible topics or themes** that might come up during a personal or phone interview.

Here’s the role definition:

# STEPS:

1. You will receive the full job description.
   Adjust the resume to fit this job description — removing or adding relevant information based on the user's context and the extra data provided.
2. Conduct a **critical and complete analysis** of the new version to determine, in percentage (%), the chances of being selected by a recruiter for the next interview stage.
   Always consider that the resume will likely be reviewed by an AI/LLM system.

# FORMAT RETURN:

- Return the **new, fully formatted resume** in proper **U.S. English and layout standards**.

  - Strengths
  - Areas for improvement

  - Reasoning behind the score
- Include:
  - Estimated **AI-based approval probability (%)**
  - **Confidence level** in your analysis
  - **Main adjustments made**
  - **Key points to focus on** for the next interview or recruiter call.

# DO NOT:

- Do not invent or fabricate information.
- Do not create data from scratch.
