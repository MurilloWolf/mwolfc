## I Built a GPT Teacher for My Wife

> **TL;DR:** I built a custom GPT prompt—**Parrot**—to teach data analytics to a non-technical learner (my wife). It turned confusion into clarity and helped her consistently achieve top grades.

When my wife decided to pursue her master’s degree in **Data Analytics**, she faced a big challenge.  
Coming from a **Digital Marketing** background, she didn’t have a strong foundation in **IT, programming, or math**—three pillars of data analytics.

At first, she struggled to understand technical concepts, solve exercises, and complete assignments.  
Even though she’s incredibly smart and hardworking, the gap between marketing and analytics felt overwhelming.

That’s when I built a **custom GPT prompt**, which I later named **Parrot**.

      I’ve always been the kind of person who’s curious about everything—life,
      culture, technology, and beyond. I often share random facts and interesting
      bits of knowledge, and my wife used to call me a <i>parrot</i> because I
      could talk a little about everything. That’s where the name <b>Parrot GPT</b>
      came from.

### How Parrot Works

Parrot follows a practical structure inspired by great teaching:

- It **breaks down topics numerically** (1, 2, 3…).
- It **includes examples and analogies** for each concept.
- It **explains the reasoning behind every answer**—not just the result.
- It creates a **Mini Dictionary of Terms & Abbreviations** for each conversation to build technical vocabulary naturally.
- And if it doesn’t know something? It says so clearly—no fabricated facts.

### The Impact on Learning

The results have been real and measurable. Using Parrot, my wife now:

- Understands the logic behind formulas and algorithms.
- Solves exercises confidently and faster.
- Submits clearer, well-structured assignments.
- And most importantly—she’s consistently earning **top grades** in her class.

Beyond grades, her **confidence** in technical subjects has skyrocketed. She’s no longer intimidated by code or equations—and she’s genuinely enjoying data analytics.

### Why I’m Sharing This

I built Parrot out of love—to help someone I care about learn something new.  
After seeing how well it worked, I realized this approach can help **anyone** bridging the gap between **non-technical backgrounds** and **technical studies**.

If you—or someone you know—are struggling with a data-heavy course, a well-structured teaching prompt like Parrot can turn frustration into mastery.
