When I think about the future, it’s impressive to imagine where we’ll be in a few years. Thinking about all the development that Artificial Intelligence can bring always makes me reflect: what do I need to do now to provide a good future for my family?

I’m still young, and I believe I should spend my time building something that gives me financial comfort and also professional fulfillment. Since the beginning of my career as a developer, I thought about how I could create something that was mine, something that would make me feel proud of myself.

But even after years working with software development — including in big techs in Latin America — I realize that I still haven’t created anything truly mine. And this emptiness has always been accompanied by an intrusive, almost self-sabotaging thought: “What if I can’t create something good?”

The problem was that I always thought I needed to start with something perfect: best programming practices, scalability, robust architectures, design patterns… This excessive concern with over engineering killed my ideas and projects for years.

Today, at the peak of my career, I can see things more clearly: in practice, there are no truly good softwares. What we have are functional ones — some better, some worse — but truly excellent ones are extremely rare, even in the biggest companies.

The sooner you understand this, the sooner you will free yourself from the same curse that haunted me for years: the pursuit of perfection.

## When reality hit

At the end of 2024, working at a large international company, I saw something surreal happen. There was an internal rush for a ridiculously simple reason: <strong>after 25 years in the market</strong>, the system was about to break because the <strong>user ID was an INT</strong>. That’s right: 25 years running with a flaw that any programming student would avoid even in their simplest projects — that was the moment my mindset changed.

If a billion-dollar company reached this point with such a basic mistake, why does my personal MVP need to be born perfect?

I could fill countless paragraphs describing bizarre mistakes I’ve seen over the years, but just to give a clearer example: in that same company, there were so many layers of over engineering that, to create a simple modal triggered by clicking a link, I had to modify three different projects — and the task was given a one-month deadline. And that was me as a senior.

## The "American Dream"

When I arrived in the United States and had to restart my life from scratch, I faced basic tasks I hadn’t done in years: getting internet service, a phone plan, grocery store memberships, finding an apartment to rent. All of this, which should have been part of fulfilling a dream — the famous American Dream — ended up being a big frustration.
During this period, I had to use apps from American companies that, even if not as well-known in Brazil as Instagram or Amazon, were still large companies.<strong> And the experience was simply terrible.</strong>

<strong>You can’t solve anything 100% online </strong> — often, not even 60%. For
most things, you need to call. Yes, call, like our parents used to do in the ’90s.
And I’m not talking about calling to cancel a service. I’m talking about calling
to sign up for a new plan — in other words, to bring profit to the company — and
yet there’s still an absurd barrier to entry.

To make matters worse, all the sites looked like they had been developed by back-end programmers. (My back-end friend, no offense, but if you don’t know how to center a div, it’s hard to believe you’ll deliver a decent, responsive, and user-friendly layout.)

## Conclusion

<strong>There are no perfect softwares.</strong> In fact, finding one that’s just
“good” is already extremely rare. Many companies make fortunes with bad products,
horrible experiences, and solutions that don’t solve problems in a simple way.

And no, <strong>AI will not solve this on its own.</strong> After all, it learns from us — and if we, humans, still haven’t managed to create truly good software, how can we expect AI to do differently?

<strong>
  That’s why you shouldn’t hold back from creating something just because it
  won’t be perfect. Perfect has never existed. But functional can change your
  life.
